          Add photos of interesting, rare, or delicious Oreo flavors you've tried here!
          
          ## Tips for Great Oreo Photos
          
          - Take photos in good lighting
          - Include the packaging when possible
          - Add the date and location where you found it
          - Consider before/after shots (whole cookie vs. eaten)
          
          ## Organization Ideas
          
          You could organize photos by:
          - Year discovered
          - Flavor category (chocolate, fruity, seasonal, etc.)
          - Rating (favorites, least favorites)
          - Rarity (common, limited edition, international)
